      <h2>How LimeSpot&#39;s Personalization Increases E-commerce Efficiencies</h2>
	  </div>

        <p>"Personalization" was named by the Huffington Post as one of the top three buzzwords for e-commerce retailers in 2013. If you shop online, you&#39;ll know - in many online stores, shoppers benefit from some limited personalization by getting recommendations based on purchasing history and trends.</p>
		<p>Traditional e-commerce, while amazing for enabling people to shop from anywhere, is naturally inefficient. It takes a long time for customers to navigate online stores and dig through pages of products before finding something they like. In physical brick-and-mortar stores, you often get a charismatic sales clerk who can tell what you might like just by looking at you; but when you shop online you&#39;re searching alone in unfamiliar territory.</p>
		<p>That&#39;s where personalization comes in. If a retailer knows what a shopper likes, the shopper can immediately be shown products they&#39;re interested in, saving them time and increasing sales.</p>
		<p>Today&#39;s personalization engines have a window into what an individual shopper&#39;s tastes and interests are by examining their purchase or internet browsing history. While better than no personalization at all, such techniques have obvious limitations. Purchase history is only useful for long-time customers, and using internet history to determine what an individual likes isn&#39;t accurate on devices with multiple users, nor is it best practice from a privacy/security perspective.</p>
		<p>Those who study e-commerce personalization constantly lament how nobody has succeeded in powering recommendation engines with social networks. After all, millions of social network profiles exist filled with data that identifies the owner&#39;s demographic and (quite literally) likes. This data is especially rich for internet-savvy young adults who are the growing population of online shoppers. From a personalization perspective, social networks are indeed the most significant, and most untapped, current source of consumer information.</p>
		<p>That&#39;s not to say it hasn&#39;t been tried. The most significant attempt occurred in 2010, when Facebook created an "instant personalization" service that would automatically adjust a website&#39;s content to the Facebook account of the person viewing it. The reason it failed is two-fold. First, the personalization occurred automatically without the user&#39;s consent. Second, every website equipped with Facebook&#39;s instant personalization could store each visitor&#39;s social media data. Ultimately the service was a bust due to the serious internet privacy concerns it raised.</p>
		<p>Studying these trends and events, and understanding how we could do it better, LimeSpot has created the world&#39;s first e-commerce personalization engine powered by social network profiles and equipped with airtight privacy and security. Our unique algorithm can identify a shopper&#39;s unique tastes and interests based on their social network profile (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), yet it never stores or shares that profile information. We also believe in full transparency: the shopper only receives personalized recommendations if they choose to authorize LimeSpot.</p>
		<p>With our technology, online shoppers can enjoy the perks of highly-accurate personalization, based on who they are now and not who they were, without having to worry about who is seeing their information.</p>
		<p>So, e-commerce experts, you predicted that personalization based on social networks would enhance e-commerce sales tenfold. Welcome to LimeSpot, making that story a reality.</p>
