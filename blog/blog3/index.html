      <h2>Why Facebook Shops Haven&#39;t Worked</h2>
	  </div>
	  
	  <br></br>

      <div class="text-left">
        <p>A few years ago recognizable brand-names like The Gap and Nordstrom had shops on their Facebook pages. These businesses soon found, however, that they weren&#39;t making profits off these stores and shut them down quickly. Nowadays there are several Facebook shop Apps available that allow businesses to create stores on their Facebook pages, but these haven&#39;t found resounding success either. Want proof? Ask your friends if they&#39;ve ever even heard of Facebook shops.</p>
		<p>The popularity and widespread usage of social networks suggest that they have the potential to radically transform e-commerce, yet attempts in this direction by some of the world&#39;s most successful businesses have been met with failure. A lingering question on every tech junkie&#39;s mind is simply, "why?"</p>
		<p>Analyzing the shortcomings of these shops is simple enough: shoppers weren&#39;t offered enough utility. The initial wave of Facebook shops was identical to pre-existing online stores, but slower. So why would consumers want to engage with this new sales channel? The newer wave of Facebook shop Apps have added social features so shoppers can like, comment on, and share products, but this doesn&#39;t seem to have translated into success. After all, Facebook users can already post about specific products if they feel so inclined.</p>
		<p>An additional (and quite important) shortcoming of failed Facebook shops is that people on Facebook generally don&#39;t intend to do shopping there. Whereas visitors to conventional stores are looking for, and are thus receptive to, product offerings, most people on Facebook just want to talk to their friends and browse funny cat pictures.</p>
		<p>A more vital question to ask is how social networks can be harnessed to improve e-commerce? As LimeSpot has found, this requires throwing existing ideas surrounding Facebook shops more or less out the window. There are two critical conclusions we have arrived at which separate LimeSpot from the failed "social commerce" attempts of the past.</p>
		<p>First off, stores that harness social networks need to offer more features with greater utility to shoppers. In addition to enhancing the social features seen in Facebook shops, LimeSpot-powered stores offer advanced personalization, gift-finding tools, and data security. These features don&#39;t just increase store traffic; they also directly increase sales efficiencies (see <a href="http://blog.limespot.com/blog1/">"How Does LimeSpot&#39;s Personalization Increase E-Commerce Efficiency?"</a>).</p>
		<p>Second, such stores can&#39;t only exist on social networks; they need to operate on conventional websites too. While dramatically improved utility would certainly augment the profitability of stores on social networks, real gains are to be seen on dedicated e-commerce websites where visitors intend to shop. LimeSpot doesn&#39;t just bring e-commerce to social networks &ndash; it brings socialization and personalization to e-commerce websites.  </p>
		<p>LimeSpot, as such, is categorically not a Facebook shop. Whereas Facebook shops failed because they offered limited features in limited places, we offer a diverse, useful set of e-commerce tools that can be used on social networks or conventional websites.  </p>
