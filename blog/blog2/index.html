      <div class="text-left">
        <p>LimeSpot-powered stores have a variety of exciting features that the world hasn&#39;t seen before. Here are just some which make LimeSpot the leader of the pack.</p>
		<h4>Advanced and Secure Personalization</h4>
		<p>Social networks are reputed as an incredibly rich, but as yet untapped, source of consumer information. When a shopper enters a LimeSpot powered store they&#39;re asked to authorize LimeSpot to enjoy a secure, personalized shopping experience. Once authorized, LimeSpot processes the information from the shopper&#39;s social network profile (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) to determine their demographic and tastes. LimeSpot then selects and shows the shopper specific products from your catalogues that they are likely to be interested in. Result - shoppers visiting your LimeSpot-powered store will immediately see the products they are most likely to purchase.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, your shoppers will be confident knowing their social network information is safe as LimeSpot&#39;s engine operates without storing or sharing any profile data. It is real-time, on the fly personalization, based on who the shopper is now and not who they were.</p>
		<h4>Gift Giving</h4>
		<p>The great thing about the LimeSpot personalization engine is that it can work for your shoppers when they&#39;re in a gift-giving pinch. If a shopper goes to your LimeSpot-powered store in search of a gift for a loved one, they merely need to click on their friend&#39;s social profile to see what you would recommend.</p>
		<h4>Social Features</h4>
		<p>People love to shop together socially in real life. We think they should be able to shop together online too. Products in LimeSpot-powered stores can be rated, commented on, reviewed, or shared on a social network. Customers can use LimeSpot to interact directly with a brand or make group purchases.</p>
		<h4>A New Sales Channel</h4>
		<p>You can have LimeSpot-powered e-commerce on your traditional website and your Facebook page. The public will be able to browse your engaging social media posts and buy your products at the same time.</p>
		<h4>Oh, the Benefits You&#39;ll Reap</h4>
		<p>The features listed above sound amazing, but we bet you&#39;re wondering how they will translate to profit?</p>
		<p>The standout feature of a LimeSpot-powered store is its advanced personalization. Shoppers in your store immediately see the products they&#39;re most likely to be interested in. That means anyone coming to your store will be more likely to make a purchase. (For more details on LimeSpot&#39;s increased e-commerce sales efficiencies, see <a href="http://blog.limespot.com/blog1/">this</a> blog post.</p>
		<p>With advanced personalization, LimeSpot gives you the best possible opportunity to attract new customers to build that all-important customer base.</p>
		<p>Finally, you can expect a bonus enhanced social media presence from a LimeSpot-powered store. Having a store on your Facebook page will drive shoppers to your social media posts and your social media fans to your store. Our social features lets shoppers share your products directly with their friends for free, resulting in a beautiful thing - organic publicity.</p>
