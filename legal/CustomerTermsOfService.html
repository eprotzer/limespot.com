or other charges appearing on such invoice; after this ten (10) day period you
will be deemed to accept all Commissions appearing on such invoice as valid and
such Commissions will become due and payable.  All amounts payable under this

or withholding.  Plan Fees and Commissions for any new Products or new feature
of a Product will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the
Website or to your Account, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice to
you.  We may increase the Plan Fees or Commissions or add new fees, charges or
commissions for any existing Product by giving you at least 30 days’ advance
notice.  We may charge you interest at the rate of 18% per annum, calculated monthly,
