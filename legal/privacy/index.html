<p><b>We May Collect Your Information</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>From You Directly.</b> When you engage in activities with us directly, on our Web site or within our products or software, such as by sending us e-mail, completing surveys or site registrations, ordering or registering for products, requesting technical support, or subscribing to newsletters or e-mail publications, we may collect certain information, including but not limited to Contact Information and Demographic Information (as those terms are defined below). By engaging in any of the foregoing activities, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you provided to us.  </li>
<li><b>Through a SNS.</b> When you use or access our products or software through a SNS you allow us to access certain information from your profile for that SNS. This information may vary and is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish at the SNS. You can control and find out more about these setting at the SNS where you access or use our products or software.

</ul>

<h4>The Type of Information we May Collect</h4>
<p>We may collect two types of information from you.  </p>
<p>The first type of information is used to allow LimeSpot to provide the personalized shopping experience, and includes but is not limited to information such as your age, gender, location and interests ("Demographic Information"). Demographic Information will generally be information that is collected through the access you have allowed us to have to your SNS profile. Demographic Information is anonymized prior to storage, meaning that it is not traceable to you personally or linked in any way to your name or SNS profile.  </p>
<p>The second type of information is information that you provide to us directly, which includes but is not limited to your name, address, phone number, email address and similar types of information ("Contact Information"). For example, we will collect Contact Information from you when you register for a LimeSpot powered store or for the purposes of delivering products that you purchase through a LimeSpot powered store.</p>

<h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>
<p>We will not sell, rent, lease, share or otherwise disclose your information to third parties unless required by law or unless you provide consent to such disclosure. Certain information collected from you and/or about you is used within the context of providing our products, software and services to you. By using our products and software, you are deemed to have provided us with a valid written consent to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Services.</b> We may use your information in connection with the services and features we provide to you and others. This will include use of your information, including Demographic Information, to provide you with a personalized shopping experience. We will also use your information, including both Demographic Information and Contact Information, to improve the quality of our products and services.</li>
<li><b>Investigations and Protection.</b> LimeSpot may release your information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, to prevent violations of LimeSpot&#39;s and enforce or apply our <a href="http://legal.limespot.com/serviceterms/">Customer Terms of Service</a>, <a href="http://legal.limespot.com/EULA/">End User License Agreement</a> or any other agreement that we may have entered into with you, or to protect the rights, property or safety of LimeSpot and others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. LimeSpot may cooperate with and disclose information (including your Account Information) to any authority, government official or third party, without giving any notice to you, in connection with any investigation, proceeding or claim arising from an asserted illegal action or infringement whether related or unrelated to your use or misuse of your Account.</li>
<li><b>Third Party Service Providres.</b> LimeSpot may employ or engage other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share some of your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples of this may include fulfilling orders, analyzing data, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. These third parties have access to information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purpose.</li>
<li><b>Business Partners.</b> If we share your Demographic Information with any of our partners or customers, then as always this information will be anonymized and not traceable to you personally. If we share Contact Information with our partners or customers, then unless your specific Contact Information is required for the specific purpose of utilizing our products and services, this Contact Information will be aggregated or combined with the Contact Information of others so that it is anonymized and not traceable to you. </li>
<li><b>Business Transfer.</b> As we continue to develop our business, we may purchase other businesses or companies, be acquired by another entity, or merge or enter into a joint venture or other type of business combination with another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to a third party. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises of this Privacy Policy (unless the customer otherwise consents). </li>
</ul>
<p>Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide our products, software and services as they exist today, but it also allows us to provide you with new innovative features, products, software and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.</p>
<p>LimeSpot owns the databases and all rights to our applications and software. While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. </p>

<h4>How We Keep Your Information Secure</h4>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. We implement reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>
<p>When we handle your sensitive information on the Internet we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL"). When dealing with payment transactions we process these through third party payment gateways (e.g., PayPal) and rely on their security systems.</p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur. </p>
<p>It is important for you to take steps to keep your information safe and protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.  </p>
<p>If you access our products and services from or through a SNS and your SNS account is hacked or other accessed by an unauthorized user, this may lead to unauthorized use of our products and services, so be careful to keep your SNS account information secure.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how we strive to keep your information secure, you can e-mail us at: legal@LimeSpot.com.</p>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>If you are a resident of any country outside the United States, including, without limitation, Canada or any country within the European Union, you understand and agree that we may store and process your personal information on computers located in the United States, and that by providing any information to us, you consent to the transfer of such information to the United States.</p>

<h4>How to Access or Update Your Information</h4>
<p>To update or change any information that you have provided directly to us, including but not limited to Contact Information, you may contact us at support@LimeSpot.com. To update or change any information that we may receive about you through a SNS, such as Demographic Information, you should follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and/or changing your privacy settings.</p>
<p>If you access our products or software through a SNS and no longer want us to make active use of your information, you may revoke LimeSpot&#39;s authorization to access your profile through that SNS. Please note that certain records will be retained for legal and accounting purposes. If you have sent or posted content through our products and software or used our products and software to interact with third parties, we may not be able to delete this type of information.</p>
