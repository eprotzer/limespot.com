</li>

<li>
<span><b>6.2</span>
<i>Fees.</i></b> We will calculate and bill Plan Fees and Commissions on a monthly basis as calculated from the date on which you create your Account or on a more frequent basis as in our sole discretion (each, a "Billing Cycle"). Your first Billing Cycle will begin on the day that you create your Account, and this day, or the next closest day, of each month will be used as the first day of each following Billing Cycle (for example, if you create your Account on the 5th of January, your Billing Cycle will begin on the 5th day of each month, or, if you create your Account on the 31st of March, your Billing Cycle will begin on the 31st day of each month, or, for months that do not have a 31st, day, the last day of that month).

<i>Payment.</i></b> You will pay us the Plan Fees and Commissions by credit card or, at our sole discretion, by another payment method that we support.

All Plan Fees are due and payable in advance, with the first Plan Fee payment due and payable at the time you create your Account and select your LimeSpot Plan and thereafter on the first day of each Billing Cycle. We will deliver to you by email or a posting to your Account, in our discretion, an invoice for such Commissions following the end of each Billing Cycle. Commissions will be invoiced in arrears following each Billing Cycle. You will have ten (10) calendar days from the date that an invoice for Commissions is delivered to dispute any Commissions or other charges appearing on such invoice; after this ten (10) calendar day period you will be deemed to accept all Commissions appearing on such invoice as valid and such Commissions will become due and payable. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be made without setoff or counterclaim and without any deduction or withholding. Plan Fees and Commissions for any new Products or new feature of a Product will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the Website or to your Account, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice to you.  
</li>

<li>
<span><b>6.4</span>
<i>Interest, Increases.</i></b> We may increase the Plan Fees or Commissions or add new fees, charges or commissions for any existing Product by giving you at least 30 days&#39; advance notice. We may charge you interest at the rate of 18% per annum, calculated monthly, on all late payments.

If any deduction or withholding is required by applicable law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.  
</li>

<li>
<span><b>6.7</span>
<i>Canadian Taxes.</i></b> If you are a resident of Canada, you are responsible for all applicable Taxes, including, but not limited to, GST, HST and/or PST, as applicable based on the billing address you provide to us, that arise from or as a result of your use of the Products.  
</li>

<li>
<span><b>6.8</span>

Any change to your LimeSpot Plan will be effective the following business day. If you change your LimeSpot Plan on a day that falls during the middle of a Billing Cycle and the change to your LimeSpot Plan results in a lower monthly Plan Fee, then no refund will be provided to you and the new Plan Fee will be in effect as of the first day of the following Billing Cycle. If you change your LimeSpot Plan on a day that falls during the middle of a Billing Cycle and the change to your LimeSpot Plan results in a higher monthly Plan Fee, then the pro-rated increase in the Plan Fee for the applicable Billing Cycle will be payable immediately at the time the LimeSpot Plan is changed.
