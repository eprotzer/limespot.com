				<h2>Extended Product Attributes</h2>
				<p>This section describes the fundamental high-level terms related to your LimeSpot storefront. You should assign values to the fields mentioned below before you start adding products to your online store. Product Attributes help you in organizing and managing your products better.</p>
				<p>Every product has the following Product Attributes, which will be explained in this article in detail:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="#industry">Industry</a>: You should choose a suitable Industry name that provides an overview of the products you wish to sell online. You can have multiple industries associated with your LimeSpot store. </li>
					<li><a href="#product-types">Product Types</a>:  A subsection of Industry that groups related products under a single identity. </li>
					<li><a href="#product-variants">Product Variants</a>: Different variations of a singular product in terms of size, color or any other product parameters of your choice.</li>
					<li><a href="#collections">Collections</a>: Logical clusters of different product that share some common characteristics like style, price etc. Individual products can be placed in different collections as per the business needs.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3><a id="industry"></a>Industry</h3>
				<p>Industry provides a quick glance into the type of products you wish to sell online. LimeSpot gives you the freedom of choosing single or multiple Industries relevant to your online Store. Every industry can be associated with multiple Product Types, which can further be associated with multiple Products.</p>
				<p>For more details on Product Types read further on this page.</p>
				<h4>How to Select Your Industries</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>From the Admin Panel, click on Store Settings and then Account Settings.</li>
					<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and select relevant Industries, as shown in the image below.</li>
					<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/extended-attributes-1.png" />
					<li>Click Save to complete the process.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You can use Checkboxes to select any particular industry. There is no upper limit on the number of industries you can choose for your store. However, it is strongly advised to select the most relevant industry names.</p>
				<p>Suppose you want to create a Sport Goods store (similar to Nike); you could have following set of Industries and Product Types.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/extended-attributes-table.png" />
				<p>Please note that this example is for illustration purpose only. You are free to choose your own Industry/Industries and related Product Type(s). For a complete set of LimeSpot recommended Industries and Product Types click here.</p>
				<p>As a standard practice, choose and update selected Industries every time you add a new batch of products.</p>
				<p>Associating your products with the right combination of Industry & Product Type helps your customers find products and it also helps you in better product management and product placement.</p>
				<h3><a id="/product-types"></a>Product Types</h3>
				<p>Product Types are used to group related Products under a single identity. For example, consider Basketball as a Product Type. The associated products can be any related basket products like balls, hoops and accessories. To summarize, any basketball-related product that you wish to sell on your online shop should be associated with this Product Type.</p>
				<p>LimeSpot automatically generates a list of Product Types so as to capture different subsections of your Industry.  For example, if you are creating a store for Pet Products then some of your Product Types could be Pet Food, Pet Accessories, and Pet Medical Supplies etc.</p>
				<h4>How to Associate Products with Product Types</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Select Products from the Admin Panel.</li>
					<li>Edit an existing Product or create a new one.</li>
					<li>Locate the dropdown box titled Type.</li>
					<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/extended-attributes-2.png" />
					<li>Select a relevant Product Type.</li>
					<li>Click Save to complete the process.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Please note that available Product Type options are based on the Industries you selected from Account Settings previously. Try selecting more industries if you are unable to find a Product Type of your choice.</p>
				<h3><a id="product-variants"></a>Product Variants</h3>
				<p>If your product comes in different sizes, material or colors then instead of creating a new product for each type, you should create product variants. If there is only one version of your product you should list only a single variant under that product.</p>
				<p>Before creating product variants, you should create Product Attributes. A product attribute is a field that describes the difference between Product Variants. For example, if you are selling jackets your product attributes could be &#39;Size&#39; and &#39;Color&#39;. </p>
				<p>You can have a maximum of five product attributes for your LimeSpot shop. Product attributes can be created from &#39;Account&#39; section of Admin Panel. </p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/extended-attributes-5.png" />
				<h4>How to Create Product Attributes</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Click on Account Settings from the Admin Panel.</li>
					<li>Scroll to the bottom on page and look for Product Variant Extended Attributes.</li>
					<li>Fill in the required attributes.</li>
					<li>Click Save to complete the process.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Once you create the Product Attributes of your choice, you can find these attributes listed under the Variant section of Product description page.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/extended-attributes-6.png" />
				<p>You can now add multiple product variants with different product attributes of your choice.  Thus in our previous example of jackets, you could have two colors available (eg, Red and Blue) in three different sizes (e.g. Small, Medium and Large).</p>
				<p>Your product variants could have following combinations of Product Attributes:</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/extended-attributes-table2.png" />
				<p>You can enter other details of product variants (Title, Barcode, Price etc.) as per the product description.</p>
				<h4>How to Create Product Variants</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Click on Products from the Administrative Panel.</li>
					<li>Edit an existing Product or create a new one.</li>
					<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and look for a section titled Variants.</li>

					<li>To add more variants click on the + icon again.</li>
					<li>Click Save to complete the process and exit.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You can delete a Product Variant by simply clicking on delete icon present in same row as the variant.</p>
				<h4>Product Properties</h4>
				<p>Every Product Variant has nine fixed Product Properties and up to a maximum of five Product Attributes. Following is the description of nine fixed product properties.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Default Variant Toggle: Sets the variant that shoppers will see by default when looking at the product.</li>
					<li>Title: The title of the variant that shoppers see on your online shop.</li>
					<li>Barcode: The variant&#39;s barcode, if applicable.</li>
					<li>SKU: The variant&#39;s SKU number.</li>
					<li>Price: The net sale price of the product variant.</li>
					<li>Original Price: If the variant has been discounted, its original price.</li>
					<li>Stock Override: A checkbox that permits our system to continue selling a variant irrespective of Stock Quantity. </li>
					<li>Stock Quantity: It is the measure of stock available for a variant. Stock Quantity is reduced every time a product variant is sold and sale is automatically suspended if its stock quantity gets zero. Use Stock Override checkbox to disable this feature.</li>
					<li>Active/Inactive Toggle: a checkbox that toggles whether or not the variant will appear for the product.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>How to Delete a Product Variant</h4>
				<p>You can delete a Product Variant by clicking on the Delete icon present in the same row as the product variant.</p>
				<h3><a id="collections"></a>Collections</h3>
				<p>Collections are used to group related products with some kind of similarities such as style, price, size etc. You are free to create your own collection names and add products accordingly. For example, if you are creating an online store for Fashion clothing some of your collection could be Spring Collection, Men&#39;s Fashion, Summer Sale or Latest Fashion.</p>
				<p>You can create as many collections as you want and associate collection with the related products. Note that a single product can be associated with one or more collections.</p>
				<h4>How to Create a New Collection</h4>
