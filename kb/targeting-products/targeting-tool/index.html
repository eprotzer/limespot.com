				<h2>The Targeting Tool</h2>
				<p>You can use the Targeting Tool for fast and efficient targeting of multiple products. To access the Targeting Tool log in to Admin Panel, go to Products and Contents, then click on Targeting Tool. </p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/targeting-tool-1.png" />
				<p>You can see the list of all existing products on the Left Panel. Clicking on any product opens up a targeting window on the right. </p>
				<p>Enter Targeting Keywords and apply Targeting rules as needed. Click on Save to complete the process or simply move on to next product. Our system saves your changes in the background.</p>
				<h3>Targeting Keywoords</h3>
				<p>Our engine uses Targeting Keywords to prioritize products based on shopper&#39;s interests. Any product can be related to a few Keywords. For example, a pair of basketball shoes could use the Keywords NBA, FIBA, Sport, Michael Jordon, etc. You should enter a few targeting keywords for each of your products. Our engine looks for these keywords in your shopper&#39;s social profile to show the most relevant product to your shoppers.</p>
				<p>As a best practice, you should enter at least three Targeting Keywords for every product. LimeSpot&#39;s algorithm then automatically builds up a larger database of Keywords by finding related words. </p>
